##Identify a topic or a problem that you want to research.  Provide an introduction that explains the problem statement or topic you are addressing. Why would someone be interested in this?  How is it a data science problem?

We live in interesting times with a pandemic that affects the way of life of every living being on the globe. Every government and public agency has tried to either slow down spread of Covid-19  by travel restrictions/lockdowns/masking & social distancing policies or mitigate its impacts by vaccination campaign. I would like to explore if the mitigation approaches taken by several governments on the spread of Covid-19 had any impact and which approach(s) had higher impact on slowing down the spread. 
Governments,health agencies and Public health policy makers across different globe should be very interested in this analysis. This should help understand the likely effective course to be taken, whenever such a pandemic appears next time. 
There are various variables and data elements that could be contributing or affecting the slowdown of the Covid-19 spread. Also the sheer volume of data that could be collected and analyzed, to understand the likely correlation and causation factors make this a data science problem. 

##Draft 5-10 Research questions that focus on the problem statement/topic.

What are the possible data sources to explore, showing the Covid-19 case history/Trend?
What are the various conditions that impact the spread of the Covid-19 virus?
How is the data collected by identified sources?
Incase of any missing elements/gaps in data, how are they mutated?
Which geographical region is a best representation for sample analysis?
What are different mitigation approaches taken to slow the spread of Covid-19 and their timeline?
What is the vaccination timeline (1 dose and 2 dosage) for the same geographical region?

##Provide a concise explanation of how you plan to address this problem statement.

I would like to validate different data sources,to collect the information on Covid-19 infection/case rate(Concentrating on USA), Collect different mitigation actions taken to slow the spread of infections and Collect vaccination rate for the same period/regions. Once this data is collected, I would like to look at the geographical region that has best representation by completeness and cohesive data. Once the sample is identified, would like to preform calculations on correlating factors and as well try to identify a model that would should best possible predictors for infection spread rate.
This calculated model should identify the best possible predictors that would determine the spread of virus.

##Discuss how your proposed approach will address (fully or partially) this problem.

as described above, the calculated model should give us the best predictors to calculate the possible virus spread rate. This should help understanding the correlation of mitigation/vacciation on spread of virus, and should give a likely course of action that could be taken by public health care policy makers to address current/future pandemics.

##Do some digging and find at least 3 datasets that you can use to address the issue. (There is not a required number of fields or rows for these datasets)
#Original source where the data was obtained is cited and, if possible, hyperlinked.

Source1 - CDC covid data - https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf
Source2 - JohnHopkins Covid Data - https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map
Source3 - Worldometer- https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

#Source data is thoroughly explained (i.e. what was the original purpose of the data, when was it collected, how many variables did the original have, explain any peculiarities of the source data such as how missing values are recorded, or how data was imputed, etc.).
CDC Covid Data - CDC is the main health policy maker and premier disease research institute in USA. CDC collected the Covid-19 data reported by different county and state health departments. 
CDC collects that data to track/understand/predict and issue guidances for various infectious diseases spread across US. CDC has collected various factors of data including demographics, any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors. 
Most of this data is collected from various county/city/state reporting agencies that reported information to CDC. Incase of missing data CDC made notes and provided explanation on gaps in data.

JohnHopkins Data - JohnHopkins is a leading philonthropic organization that provides suggestions and inputs on critical public health policies. JohnHopkin collects its data from various public reported sources of county/city/state data sources. They collate different sources, analyzes and provides trends as well on Covid-19 positivity rate, death rate,vaccination, hospitalization including the civic mitigating actions taken by states (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/state-timeline/new-confirmed-cases/alaska)

Worldometer- Worldometer is a independent run website that collects information from different public sources and manually compiled to validate. The data contains the number of cases deaths, active cases, recovered, total tests and test/1M, population and sources. Website also indicates projectons on how cases could have an outcome based on few factor. This website also cleary indicates the gap in data or facotrs impacting the data collection due to any change in policies(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/about/)

##Identify the packages that are needed for your project.

Following are some of the packages that I would need for this analysis:
knitr
ggplot2
readxl
readr
purrr
RcmdrMisc
MASS
lattice
graphics
grDevices
dplyr
datasets
car
carData
olsrr


##What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the Ô¨Åndings to your research questions?

Following plots:
histogram (with Kernal Density plot)
boxplot
scatterplot (with Matrices)
line chart

also would build tables using data frame, while laoding data into data frame using read csv and xl. 
also use str and head to analyze the content of data.

##What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your research questions?

I am able to dip my toes into the modeling and test of the models built. I need to learn more on differnt regression modelling to identify correlation and confounders that could affect (using different types of variables)
